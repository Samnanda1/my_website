In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r}
x <- data.frame("maturity" = c("3m","6m","1y","2y","3y","5y","7y","10y","20y","30y"), "number" = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))
z <- full_join(x,yield_curve, by = "maturity") %>%
  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date))

```


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
ggplot(yield_curve, y = value, x = date) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = duration, x = date, y = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~factor(duration, levels=c('3-Month Treasury Bill','6-Month Treasury Bill','1-Year Treasury Rate','2-Year Treasury Rate', '3-Year Treasury Rate', '5-Year Treasury Rate', '7-Year Treasury Rate', '10-Year Treasury Rate', '20-Year Treasury Rate', '30-Year Treasury Rate')), ncol = 2, nrow = 5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury Rates since 1960",
       x = "", 
       y = "%",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```


```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r, fig.width=12.5, fig.height=9}

z %>%
  filter(year >= 1999) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(maturity, number), y = value, color = year, group = month)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4, nrow = 6) +
  labs(title = "US Yield Curve",
       x = "Maturity", 
       y = "Yield (%)",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = rainbow(12)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r, fig.width=12.5, fig.height=10}

z3m <- z %>%
  filter(duration == "3-Month Treasury Bill")

z10y <- z %>%
  filter(duration == "10-Year Treasury Rate")

z3m10y <- rbind(z3m, z10y) %>%
  filter(year >= 1999)

ggplot(z3m10y, aes(x=date, y=value, group = duration)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = duration)) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#3fcfd2", "#f99891")) +
  labs(title = "Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       x = "", 
       y = "%",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) 

```


```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01", "2020-04-30") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)


```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

```{r, fig.width=14}

z3mf <- z3m %>%
  select(date,
         value)

z10yf <- z10y %>%
  select(date,
         value)

z3m10yi <- inner_join(z3mf, z10yf, by = "date") %>%
  mutate(delta = value.y - value.x)

z3m10yf <- z3m10yi %>%
  select(date,
         delta) %>%
  mutate(sign = ifelse(delta > 0, "positive", "negative"))

recessions60 <- filter(recessions, year(from)>1959)

ggplot(z3m10yf) +
  geom_line(data = z3m10yf, aes(x = date, y = delta)) +
  geom_area(data = z3m10yf,
            aes(x = (date), y = ifelse(delta < 0, delta, 0)),
            fill =
              "#eab5b7") +
  geom_area(data = z3m10yf,
            aes(x = (date), y = ifelse(delta > 0, delta, 0)),
            fill =
              "#abc7e6")+
  geom_rect(data = recessions60, aes(xmin = From, xmax = To), ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "Difference (10 year-3 month) yield in %",
    caption = "Source: FRED Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis",
    title = "Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury rates",
    subtitle = "Difference in % points monthly averages.
Shaded areas correspond to recessions"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 years", labels= date_format("%Y"), limits = c(as.Date("1960-12-01"), as.Date("2021-01-01")))
