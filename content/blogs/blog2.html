<h2>
My Journey
<h2>
<h4>
As everyone knows, it’s impossible to fit a life story into a one page CV. Therefore using my website, it allows me to elaborate further. Here is my CV, please continue reading for an in depth review.
<h4>
<p><img src="/img/cv.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<h4>
I’ll start my journey at Senior School where I followed my older brother to an Academy, St Ambrose College. This all-boys school was renown in the area for great academics and great sport, particularly rugby, and having played rugby from an early age, was an excellent school giving me the opportunity to excel in all areas. I really enjoyed school life representing school in sports and academically in Maths competitions and eventually knuckled down to my GCSE’s completing 11, with A*s and As, and continuing into sixth form to study Maths, Economics and Geography (having stopped Physics at AS level).
<h4>
<h4>
I was delighted to be chosen by the students and staff to be Head Boy (a double accolade as I had also been chosen as Head Boy at my Junior school). Being Head Boy taught me so much, as my duties included leading the School Council, reporting to OFTED, mentoring younger pupils, and leading the school in weekly assemblies. The most challenging and rewarding experience was speaking at Presentation Evening to over 2000 people (students, teachers, parents and governors) and I’m glad to say that the many hours of practice paid off and my speech even got a few laughs!
<h4>
<h4>
I secured my place at Newcastle University with A’s in Maths and Geography and a B in Economics. Newcastle had been a firm choice from early on, (not for the legendary cheap nights out) but as I was also following my grandfather and uncle to study there, continuing a family tradition, and of course the course interested me too. My passion for Maths and the wider financial element of the degree were important to me as I felt this was the career path I would like to follow.
<h4>
<h4>
Whilst Covid interrupted my studies at Newcastle, I was delighted to graduate with a 2:1 and wanted to continue onto a Masters.
<h4>
<h4>
Given i had my university experience reduced, it was a huge factor in looking at the opportunity to do a Masters, as it would allow me to continue my studies, make new friends and play team sports.
<h4>
<h4>
LBS came to my attention when i was researching Masters, being one of the best in the UK and one that places an emphasis on practical rather then theoretical learning, it seemed an obvious choice for me. After a long month of studying for me GMAT, applying and an antagonising wait, I was finally admitted onto the Master’s in Financial Analysis course.
<h4>
<h4>
I am now 2 months into the course, and I am thoroughly enjoying my current courses;
<h4>
<h4>
-Data Analytics in Finance
<h4>
<h4>
-Investment Fundamentals
<h4>
<h4>
-Analysis of Financial Statements
<h4>
<h4>
As well as joining multiple clubs such as, the snow, expedition, PE and rugby club, i have enjoyed making many friends from many different backgrounds and nationalities.
