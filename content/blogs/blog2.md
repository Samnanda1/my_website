## **Welcome to the second tile of my website;**

As everyone knows, it's impossible to fit a life story into a one page CV. Therefore using my website, it allows me to elaborate further.

Running through my life chronologically from when i started high school, my journey started when i was 11 years old and followed in my older brothers footsteps by going to St Ambrose College. 

After spending the first few years of school making friends and playing sport, i decided that i should probably concentrate on my GCSE's so i knuckled down and completed 11 GCSE's getting A*'s and A's. Having enjoyed my experience at the school, i decided to continue there for 6th form. 

In between studying for my A-Levels of Maths, Economics and Geography, i was  chosen to be Headboy by both students and staff. It was a proud moment as i had also been Headboy at my primary school. Being Headboy taught me much about leadership and mentoring as my duties included leading the student council, reporting to OFSTED, organising events and tutoring younger pupils. The most challenging but exhilarating experience as Headboy was having to do my end of year speech in front of all pupils, teachers and parents. Speaking to 2000 people, was a unique experience i had never done, but after numerous practices the speech was a success. 

I finished 6th form with 2 A's and a B at A-Level, which allowed me to secure my place at Newcastle University studying Maths and Finance. Newcastle was my firm choice, (no, not only because of the cheap alcohol!) but because both my Grandpa and Uncle had studied there, and continuing on our families legacies of being up-north was important to me. Equally the course really interested me, continuing with my passion for maths, but also adding in the financial element, of which i knew i wanted the direction of my career to go. 

Despite having a great first year, unfortunately COVID curtailed my full experience. Mid way through year 2, lock down begun and online learning started. THe rest of my uni experience continued like this but despite this i still graduated with a 2.1. 

Given i had my university experience reduced, it was a huge factor in looking at the oppurtunity to do a Masters, as it would allow me to continue my studies, make new friends and play team sports. 

LBS came to my attention when i was researching Masters, being one of the best in the UK and one that places an emphasis on practical rather then theoretical learning, it seemed an obvious choice for me. After a long month of studying for me GMAT, applying and an antagonising wait, i was finally admitted onto the Master's in Financial Analysis course. 

I am now 2 months into the course, and i am thoroughly enjoying my current courses;

    -Data Analytics in Finance
    -Investment Fundamentals
    -Analysis of Financial Statements
    
As well as joining multiple clubs such as, the snow, expedition, pe and rugby club, i have enjoyed making many friends from so many different backgrounds and nationalities.
