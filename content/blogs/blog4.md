## **Welcome to the fifth tile of my website;**

I have been fortunate enough to combine my love of travel and love of helping people through charity missions.

In 2016 I volunteered with the Leadership at Sea Charity, for one leg of the Tall Ship race. I sailed on board Tenacious, the largest wooden tall ship of her kind in the world, it is designed and built to be fully accessible for people with disabilities. I joined as part of the permanent crew for the week to help with the sailing of the ship and giving those less fortunate the opportunity to sail from Lisbon to Cadiz. 

It was an incredible opportunity to meet such inspirational people, who had terminal illnesses but had the courage and determination to undergo a challenging task for anyone let alone someone in a wheelchair. I had the pleasure of hoisting a friend in a wheelchair up 27 meters to the top of the mast. Giving him the oppurtunity to do this was inspirational for me and the experience taught me the value of communication, teamwork, leadership and the importance of never prejudging people.
