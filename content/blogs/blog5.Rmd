<h2> Welcome <h2>

<h4> I’d like to showcase a little more about myself, so that you can get a feel for me as a person and my nature and demonstrate how I strive to do the very best in every situation. <h4>

<h3> Introduction <h3>

<h4> Having graduated from Newcastle University with a 2:1 in Maths and Finance, I am delighted to be reading for the Master’s in Financial Analysis at London Business School.  I am an enthusiastic, highly motivated and reliable individual and my warm personality and great attention to detail ensures that all tasks are completed efficiently to the best of my ability, whether academically, professionally or socially. <h4>

<h4> Whilst I have thrown myself into LBS academically, I have also joined many of their clubs, from sporting ones, Rugby and Skiing to name but two, to career orientated ones, Finance and Coding and Charity based ones. <h4>

<h4> The clubs encourage great networking between the current students and alumni adding to a the culture that is part of LBS. <h4>
