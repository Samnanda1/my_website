## *Welcome to the first tile of my website;*

I created this website for a data analytics module whilst i was studying at LBS, to showcase a little about myself in a more fun and interactive way then a CV.

### So here's my introduction:

I am currently studying at London Business School after graduating from Newcastle University with a Maths and Finance Degree. Whilst at LBS, i have thrown myself both in to the academic side of my Master's in Financial Analysis course, as well as the extra curricular activities, by joining multiple clubs such as the finance and the rugby club. I am a highly motivated, enthusiastic and a reliable individual with a warm personality and great attention to detail. This has allowed me to excel in in my academic, professional and social life.
