## **Welcome to the second tile of my website;**

As everyone knows, it's impossible to fit a life story into a one page CV. Therefore using my website, it allows me to elaborate further.

Running through my life chronologically from when i started high school, my journey started when i was 11 years old and followed in my older brothers footsteps by going to St Ambrose College. This is where i completed my GCSE and A-Levels.
