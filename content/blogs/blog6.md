## **Welcome to the third tile of my website;**

At 16, it was time to get my act together, and start thinking about careers. I gained three work experiences, one at an engineering firm, one a law firm and the other a PE firm. Of the three, the PE firm, SICP, excited me the most. It was fast paced and client facing. Since then i have been set on a career in finance and have continued to pursue internships in this field. 

In 2019, i gained a summer internship at Mazar's in Manchester in their Corporate Finance team. This was my first real exposure to M&A. The internship was a month long, and I was fortunate enough to join during a live deal. The team were in the process of creating an IM for an apprenticeship firm looking to sell.  So from day 1, I was performing market research for this sector and using Orbis and MarketIQ to find recent deals so we could use this to find a range for the EBITDA multiple. 

After completing the model valuation for the firm and validating the accounts we had been sent from them, we used this to create a football field, with projected returns for PE houses given different scenarios and time horizons. 

The internship continued to inspire me throughout, working with equally driven people, being able to use my problem and analytical skills and with having a large client focus, I knew this was the correct field for me. 

During the pandemic I got a job in the finance department of a specialist fire engineering company; Alpine. Whilst this wasn’t my desired field, to gain a better understanding of management accounting, and how company’s work was very useful. For example, I learned how to use sage, and analysed customer inflows and outflows allowing me to map potential methods for up-sell. 

Finally in the summer of 2021, I gained work experience at Investec in their investment banking division. I was back to doing what I enjoyed, M&A. Again I was fortunate enough to join during a deal, a £30 million LBO in the software and technology sector. This time I joined at the start of the deal and so helped prepare the IM from the start as well as doing the valuation myself. 

I then distributed the IM to several relevant PE firms, and then set up agendas and management meetings between the firm and the PE houses. 

Unfortunately I wasn’t there to see the end of the deal, however I have since heard it was sold successfully. 

I am now in the process of looking for a summer 2022 internship.
